# EduXPU 
**Scalable GPU-Powered Education Platform**

EduXPU is a high-performance learning platform designed for students, educators, and researchers to access **real-time GPU/XPU resources** for hands-on computing.  
Built for hackathons, classrooms, and labs ‚Äî it provides secure sandboxed environments, seamless collaboration, and accessible cloud-native compute for all.

---

##  Key Features
-  **On-demand GPU access** ‚Äî NVIDIA XPU-powered workloads for ML, simulations, and large-scale computation.  
-  **Secure sandboxing** ‚Äî Each student runs in an isolated container to prevent resource abuse.  
-  **Smart scheduling** ‚Äî Fair-share and priority-based compute allocation.  
-  **Education-first design** ‚Äî Preloaded templates for ML, DBMS, and system labs.  
-  **Accessible for all** ‚Äî Runs on lightweight devices, connects to cloud GPUs.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture (MVP)
- **Frontend:** React + Tailwind (student dashboards, lab access, reports).  
- **Backend:** FastAPI (or Flask) for API & orchestration.  
- **Orchestration:** Docker + Kubernetes for sandboxing & scaling.  
- **Compute layer:** NVIDIA XPU-powered backend with JupyterLab integrations.  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for user data, activity logs, and scheduling.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Day 0: Repo setup, idea framing, one-slide pitch.  
- [ ] Day 1‚Äì2: Backend API + container orchestration prototype.  
- [ ] Day 3‚Äì4: Frontend dashboard (React).  
- [ ] Day 5: GPU job submission + sandboxing integration.  
- [ ] Day 6: End-to-end demo + README polish.
